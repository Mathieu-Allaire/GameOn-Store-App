# Group 3 Introduction ‚ú®

Group 3 gives you a warm welcome to our project: **Game On**!
It was made for our [__ECSE 321: Introduction to Software Engineering__](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2024-2025/courses/ecse-321) class. Our team is composed of four software and two computer engineering students:
* [Camilo Berdugo (Computer)](https://github.com/CamiloB6)
* [Neeshal Imrit (Software)](https://github.com/Neeshal-Imrit)
* [Luis Jarquin (Software)](https://github.com/LuisAtMcGill)
* [Mathieu Allaire (Software)](https://github.com/Mathieu-Allaire)
* [Joel Boyer (Computer)](https://github.com/joelboyer293)
* [Joseph Feghaly (Software)](https://github.com/JRfeghaly)

We were commissioned by a game shop business owner ([our Professor](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/lili-wei)) to create a website that would suit her needs. We are striving to create the best website for her clients to buy gamesüéÆüïπÔ∏è.

As a team, we :
* gather requirements
* design classes
* set up and test the database
* create the user interface
* manage all interactions in the backend to provide a user-friendly platform

# Scope of the Project
The goal of the project is to design, develop, and test a web store application for a game shop.
This app will be used by the manager, the customers, and the employees on a daily basis.
The main goals are:
* Let new customers create an account with the store.
* Allow the gamers to purchase one or many games from the store
* Allow the manager to add new game categories to the store
* Permit the addition of new games to the store
* Ensure an intuitive interface for the users

After the last deliverable, there will be a thoroughly tested, functional, and user-friendly application that will allow the business of the game shop owner to grow and give the customers a great experience.
More information about the app is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Fall2024/project-group-3/wiki).
