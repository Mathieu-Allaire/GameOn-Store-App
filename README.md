* [Joel Boyer (Computer)](https://github.com/joelboyer293)
* [Joseph Feghaly (Software)](https://github.com/JRfeghaly)

We were commissioned by a game shop business owner ([our Professor](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/lili-wei)) to create a website that would suit her needs. We are striving to create the best website for her clients to buy gamesüéÆüïπÔ∏è.

As a team, we :
* gather requirements
* design classes
* set up and test the database
* create the user interface
* manage all interactions in the backend to provide a user-friendly platform
